# Ricerous - A Ricer Helper

A Nixers community project

![unit test](https://travis-ci.org/nixers-projects/ricerous.svg)


## The Idea

A kind of portable wiki diary program about ricing. It regroups altogether what
can be riced with useful information and link about it. It also let the user
notes/comments in each sections to keep track of what has been done. The notes
can then be exported/imported in multiple formats. We hope it will:

  * Make it easy to redo another person's setup.
  * Remove the mystification around the word "ricing".
  * Easily share one's setup on forums/boards.

## Goals

  * Make it easy to redo another person's setup.
  * Remove the mystification around the word "ricing".
  * Easily share one's setup on forums/boards.

## User Base

  * Beginner ricers that don't know where to start.
  * Advanced users that get lost when they want to share info about their setup.


## Instalation

The program depends on Kivy.

`git clone https://github.com/nixers-projects/ricerous`

`cd ricerous`

`sudo python2 setup.py install`

`ricerous`


## TODO list

  * Test/Debug the Program (Doesn't need programming knowledge)
